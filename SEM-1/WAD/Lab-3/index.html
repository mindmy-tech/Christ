                <p style="font-size: 28px;">Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on creating algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions. It involves training these systems with large datasets, allowing them to recognize patterns and improve over time. ML is used in various domains, from recommendation systems in streaming services to fraud detection in finance. Its ability to extract insights from data has made it a vital tool for businesses and researchers, revolutionizing how we analyze information and automate complex tasks.</p>
