                <p>
                    AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI encompasses a wide range of techniques and approaches that enable machines to perceive their environment, reason about it, and take appropriate actions. Some of the key components of AI include:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Machine Learning: A subset of AI that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.</li>
                    <li>Natural Language Processing (NLP): The ability of machines to understand and interpret human language, enabling tasks like language translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbots.</li>
                    <li>Computer Vision: The ability of machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world, enabling tasks like image recognition and object detection.</li>
                    <li>Expert Systems: AI systems designed to mimic the decision-making abilities of human experts in specific domains.</li>
                    <li>Robotics: The integration of AI and ML techniques to create intelligent robots capable of performing tasks in the physical world.</li>

            <h2>Machine Learning (ML)</h2>
            <p>
                ML is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms learn patterns from historical data and use that knowledge to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. Key types of ML algorithms include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Supervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on labeled data, where it learns the mapping between input features and corresponding output labels. It can then make predictions on new data.</li>
                <li>Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on unlabeled data, and its objective is to find patterns or groupings in the data without specific output labels.</li>
                <li>Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, enabling it to improve its performance over time.</li>
            </ul>
